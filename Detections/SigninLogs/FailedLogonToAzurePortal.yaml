name: Failed login attempts to Azure Portal
description: |
  'Identifies failed login attempts in the Azure Active Directory SigninLogs to the Azure Portal.  Many failed logon 
  attempts or some failed logon attempts from multiple IPs could indicate a potential brute force attack.  
  The following are excluded due to success and non-failure results:
  References: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-sign-ins-error-codes
  0 - successful logon
  50125 - Sign-in was interrupted due to a password reset or password registration entry.
  50140 - This error occurred due to 'Keep me signed in' interrupt when the user was signing-in.'
